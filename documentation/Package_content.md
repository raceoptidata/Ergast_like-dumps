## Pipeline Steps

1. **Data Collection from Jolpica**
   - Calls to `https://api.jolpi.ca/...` endpoints
   - Normalization, data cleaning, and transformation
   - Joins with reference tables (races, drivers, constructors, etc.)
   - Load into the MySQL working database

2. **MySQL Transfer**
   - SQL-based transfer from working database to target database
   - Executed from SQL template as a single transaction

3. **Exports**
   - SQL export from MySQL using `mysqldump`
   - `.csv` exports of all database tables
   - `.bacpac` export of SQL Server database via Azure Data Factory
   - PostgreSQL dump generated by loading `.csv` files and exporting the database

4. **Packaging**
   - Creation of a `.zip` archive containing all generated files
   - Documentation and manifest are automatically included
