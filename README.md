# RaceOptiData – F1 Data Dumps (Ergast-compatible)

Since late 2024, the Ergast Motor Racing Data API is no longer updated.  
RaceOptiData aims to keep its data schema alive by providing up-to-date, downloadable dumps (MySQL, PgSQL, Azure SQL and CSV) built from a custom pipeline.

The dumps follow the original Ergast structure, but are refreshed after each race using a modern data collection pipeline (Python + FastF1 + Azure).

🗓️ Last update: post-2025 season

## 🧰 How it's built

The RaceOptiData pipeline is a fully automated Python-based ETL that:

- Fetches F1 race data from the Jolpica (Ergast-compatible) API
- Stores it in a normalized MySQL database
- Exports dumps for MySQL, PostgreSQL, and SQL Server
- Produces CSV files, a detailed manifest, and documentation
- Uses SQLAlchemy, pandas, Azure Data Factory, and more
